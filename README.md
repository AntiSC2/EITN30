# EITN30

Welcome to the EITN30 repository, where Jakob Sinclair and Madeleine Berild have combined their genius to create a radio driver that'll make you want to tap your feet to the beat!

Now, we know what you're thinking: "Radio driver? Raspberry Pis? Threads? Sounds like a snooze-fest!" But let us assure you, this project is anything but boring.

First of all, we've implemented our driver in C++, the language that never fails to make people go "Ooh, fancy!" It's like the tuxedo of programming languages.

And if you thought one thread was exciting, just wait until you see what we've got in store for you: multiple threads! That's right, folks, we've got more threads than a quilt convention.

But wait, there's more! Our radio driver allows two Raspberry Pis to communicate with each other over IP. It's like the internet, but with a more fruity name.

So why waste time on boring projects when you can join the EITN30 party? We guarantee you'll have so much fun, you won't even realize you're learning about radio drivers and Raspberry Pis.

Disclaimer: This project is not responsible for any uncontrollable dancing that may occur while using our driver.
